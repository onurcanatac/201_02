# ComplexityAnalysis
As a homework for my CS201 class, I implemented, tested and analyzed the time complexities of three different algorithms which are used for finding if a given array contains another given array.
Those algorithms were linear search, binary search and search using frequency tables. I tested these algorithms up to very big arrays and found the average time it takes to run those algorithms for
arrays with different sizes. I documented my results, they can be found in the pdf file of the report which is included. Implemented by using C++.
